# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

To ensure that my code is functional and secure I utilize proper testing and error handling. The use of error handling can help prevent any sensitive information about the software from accidentally being exposed during a crash or failure. To ensure that my code is secure, I can utilize unit testing. These tests will check each element of my code for both valid and invalid inputs. If any area fails a test, I know that there is a flaw in the code I need to go back and correct. Proper testing gives me confidence that my code is working as expected. 

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Interpreting user needs is done through listening to user feedback, looking over product reviews, and building use cases can provide valuable insight into how the program is developed into the future. This feedback can be used to help improve existing features, help to implement new features or better understand which features are being used the most.

# How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by considering every goal the software needs achieve and who is going to be using the software. Once I understand what the requirements of the software, I create a broad overview, covering the main functions of the software. I then begin to take that broad overview, section by section and break it down into a smaller, more detailed explanation of what is needed to accomplish each section. This approach allows me to make sure that the program will meet requirements. It also allows me to more easily see which areas of the program need to be connected and share information. Once the simpler parts of the program of coded, I perform tests to make sure the foundation of the program is without faults. Once that has been confirmed, I move onto the more complex areas of the program
